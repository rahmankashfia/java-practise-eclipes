	Association
	Association refers to the relationship between multiple objects. It refers to how objects are related to each other and how they are using each other's functionality. Composition and aggregation are two types of association.
	
	Composition
	The composition is the strong type of association. An association is said to composition if an Object owns another object and another object cannot exist without the owner object. Consider the case of Human having a heart. Here Human object contains the heart and heart cannot exist without Human.
	
	Aggregation
	Aggregation is a weak association. An association is said to be aggregation if both Objects can exist independently. For example, a Team object and a Player object. The team contains multiple players but a player can exist without a team.
